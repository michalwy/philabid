## Coding Standards

### Java Code Style

- Follow standard Java naming conventions
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Add JavaDoc for public methods and classes
- Use meaningful variable and method names

### File Organization

- Keep classes focused and cohesive
- Organize imports (remove unused ones)
- Place constants at the top of the class
- Group related methods together

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use descriptive test method names
- Test both happy path and edge cases

### Documentation

- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update JavaDoc for API changes
- Include examples in documentation

## Internationalization (i18n)

When adding new UI text:

1. Add keys to `messages.properties`
2. Add translations to all language files:
   - `messages_de.properties` (German)
   - `messages_fr.properties` (French)
   - `messages_pl.properties` (Polish)
3. Use `I18nManager.getString()` in code
4. Test with different locales

## Database Changes

For database schema changes:

1. Create a new Flyway migration file in `src/main/resources/db/migration/`
2. Use format: `V{version}__{description}.sql`
3. Test migrations on clean database
4. Update corresponding model classes

## UI Guidelines

- Follow JavaFX best practices
- Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Test on different screen sizes
- Use consistent styling with existing UI
- Add proper tooltips and help text

## Pull Request Guidelines
